# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

How to run
-
1. In root directory, install gems, then start the rails server

	```
	~$ bundle install
	~$ rails s
	```

2. In another terminal window, install dependencies and start the angular server

	```
	~$ cd angular/
	~$ npm install
	~$ ng serve
	```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:4200`
4. You should see the angular welcome page. If the angular server is correctly hooked up to the rails server, you should see `API Test: api test success!` near the bottom of the page.
